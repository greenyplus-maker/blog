# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes it easy to build production-ready web applications. In this post, we'll explore the basics and get you started on your journey.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over plain React:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Better SEO and initial load performance
- **File-based Routing**: Simple and intuitive routing system
- **API Routes**: Build backend functionality alongside your frontend
- **Optimized Images**: Automatic image optimization
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Support for CSS modules and styled-components

## Creating Your First Next.js App

To create a new Next.js application, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Key Concepts

### Pages

In Next.js, pages are React components exported from files in the `pages` directory. Each file automatically becomes a route.

### Components

Reusable React components can be placed in a `components` directory and imported wherever needed.

### Styling

Next.js supports multiple styling approaches:
- Global CSS
- CSS Modules
- Styled JSX
- Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of Next.js, you can start building more complex applications. Explore the official documentation to learn about advanced features like API routes, middleware, and deployment options.

Happy coding!
